# Hotel-management-in-QT

**Qt FrameWork**
Introduction to Qt
Qt (pronounced as "cute", not "cu-tee") is a cross-platform framework that is usually used as a graphical toolkit, although it is also very helpful in creating CLI applications. It runs on the three major desktop OSes, as well as on mobile OSes, such as Symbian, Nokia Belle, Meego Harmattan, MeeGo or BB10, and on embedded devices. Ports for Android (Necessitas) and iOS are also in development.

Qt has an impressive collection of modules, including

*QtCore, a base library that provides containers, thread management, event management, and much more
*QtGui and QtWidgets, a GUI toolkit for Desktop, that provides a lot of graphical components to design applications.
*QtNetwork, that provides a useful set of classes to deal with network communications
*QtWebkit, the webkit engine, that enable the use of web pages and web apps in a Qt application.
*QtSQL, a full featured SQL RDBM abstraction layer extensible with own drivers, support for ODBC, SQLITE, MySQL and PostgreSQL is available out of the box
*QtXML, support for simple XML parsing (SAX) and DOM
*QtXmlPatterns, support for XSLT, XPath, XQuery and Schema validation

It is a room booking system GUI application. It is used to manage the data of room. In this GUI application there are many option like
